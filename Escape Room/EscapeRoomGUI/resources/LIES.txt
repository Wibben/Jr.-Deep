TASK III: LIE DETECTION

That was easy wasn't it?

  In this task, all you have to do is
  figure out the answers to the questions
  that were asked in the decrypted message
  from the last puzzle, and use those
  answers to form a codeword to move onto
  the next portion.
  
  You can question the instructors and
  your mentor as much as you'd like, try
  your best to figure out which answer is
  the truth.
