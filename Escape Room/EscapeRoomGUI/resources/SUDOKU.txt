TASK V: SUDOKU

You guys are good to have come this far,

  In this next exercise you will develop
  your logic and reasoning skills by doing
  a Sudoku puzzle. You must make sure that
  in every row, column, and section of the
  puzzle are filled with the numbers 1-9
  without any repeats.
  
  You will then apply the coordinates from
  the Morse code puzzle to the Sudoku
  puzzle to obtain a series of numbers 
  that will help you in the final puzzle.

  Do not fret though, because you will be 
  able to ask for a hint every 3 minutes to
  get one of your squares revealed for you.
