TASK III: MORSE MESSAGES

Nicely done Grade 3/4s,

  Morse code played a vital role in World 
  War II, carrying messages such as enemy 
  locations between ships and naval bases.
  
  In this next task you will need to solve
  some Morse code messages to reveal clues
  that will be useful to you in solving
  later puzzles.
  
  Don't worry if you feel like you're not
  good at hearing Morse code, because it 
  will also be flashing on the screen...
