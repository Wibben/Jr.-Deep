TASK I: HIDDEN CLUES

Welcome Grade 3/4 Spy Academy,
  You have completed a week of intense spy 
  training, and you are almost ready to 
  take on the world. But first, we need to
  look at and evaluate the results of your 
  training.
  
  Your first task is to find the hidden 
  clues scattered around the room to open 
  the first box. Figuring out how to get
  the code for the lock is up to you. 
  
  Good Luck!
