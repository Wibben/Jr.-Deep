TASK I: HIDDEN OBJECTS

Welcome Grade 3/4 Spy Academy,

  You have completed a week of spy camp,
  and you are almost done. But first, we 
  need to look at what you've learned.
  
  Your first task is to find the hidden 
  clues scattered around the room to open 
  the first box. Figuring out how to get
  the code for the lock is up to you. 
  
  Good Luck!
