ALL TASKS COMPLETE...

Congratulations Grade 3/4 Spy Academy,

  You have now sucessfully completed 
  the "Escape Room". We hope you had fun 
  during the past week and (hopefully) 
  learned something new!
  
  Was the last half of the puzzle more
  convoluted than you expected? What did
  you find was the easiest puzzle? If you
  were to hide the clues in the very first
  puzzle for next week, where would you
  put them? Let us know!
